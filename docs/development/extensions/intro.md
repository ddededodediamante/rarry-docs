# Introduction

Custom extensions allows developers to add new categories and blocks with unique functionality to the website that users can use.

There are two main type of extensions in Rarry:

- **Built-in extensions:** These extensions come by default on the editor and they cannot be modified. They can be accessed from the "Extensions List" on the editor.
- **Custom extensions:** These extensions are external and made by users. They must be added by users (or if the project has one, it will be imported automatically) and can add more features that the basic editor doesn't provide.

:::warning
Most custom extensions are made by other users, not Rarry developers.  
Only add extensions from people you **trust**!

While Rarry does add some protection, keep in mind that extension blocks can run any JavaScript code when your project runs. If you're not sure where it came from or what it does, don't add it.
